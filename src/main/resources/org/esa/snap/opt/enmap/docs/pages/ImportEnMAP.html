    The Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) is a German hyper-spectral satellite mission to monitoring and
    characterise Earth?s environment on a global scale.</p>
<b>Sensor Characteristics</b>
<ul>
    <li>Imaging push-broom hyper-spectral sensor mainly based on modified existing or pre-developed technology
    </li>
    <li>Broad spectral range from 420 nm to 1000 nm (VNIR) and from 900 nm to 2450 nm (SWIR) with high radiometric
        resolution and stability in both spectral ranges
    </li>
    <li>30 km swath width at high spatial resolution of 30 m x 30 m and off-nadir (30°) pointing feature for fast target
        revisit (4 days)
    </li>
</ul>
